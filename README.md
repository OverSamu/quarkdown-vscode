## FAQ

**Q: Why am I not getting completions for my custom functions?**  
A: The language server is young and does not perform complex analysis yet. Function data is only retrieved from the documentation found in Quarkdown's `docs` directory, thus only the stdlib is supported. This is planned to be improved in future releases.

**Q: Why aren't my function calls highlighted?**  
A: Function call highlighting happens on the server side via semantic tokens.
This should be enabled by default, but in case it isn't working properly, make sure `editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled` is set to `true`.

**Q: Why is my live preview delayed?**  
A: Compilation happens almost instantly, but it's triggered only when the document is saved. To improve the experience you might consider lowering the auto-save delay in your VS Code settings (`files.autoSaveDelay`) but beware of throttling due to high throughput.
